This tests the following:

- Symex saves the path that traverses the loop once, then the path that
  traverses the loop twice;

- Symex pops the path that traverses the loop once, then the path that
  traverses the loop twice.

The path that traverses the loop twice is the one that would cause an
assertion failure, thus that result must appear last rather than second
last.

Test that the following happens in order:
// Loop 0 times
path is successful
any lines
// Loop once
path is successful
any lines
// Loop twice
path is unsuccessful
end
