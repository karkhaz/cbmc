Test that the following happens in order:
execute line 6
// Enter loop
save next 7
// Skip loop
save jump 9
any lines
execute line 6
resume next 7
execute line 7
any lines
// Enter loop twice
save next 7
// Enter loop once & bail
save jump 9

// From this point on, we start hitting the end of paths.

// The path where we skipped over the loop completely. The path is
// nonsense, because we assume x == 1 and yet do not enter the loop;
// thus the path is infeasible and verification succeeds.
any lines
execute line 6
resume jump 9
execute line 9
any lines
path is successful

// The path where we enter the loop twice and then hit the assertion.
// The path is infeasible because we cannot execute the loop twice if x
// started out as 1.
any lines
execute line 6
resume next 7
execute line 7
any lines
path is successful

// The path where we enter the loop once and then bail out. Here, x has
// been decremented to zero, so the assertion must fail.

execute line 6
resume jump 9
execute line 9
