                        PATH EXPLORATION TESTS
                        ======================

This directory contains tests for the different path exploration
strategies when using cbmc's `--paths` flag. Every directory contains a
program whose paths will be explored in a different order by the
different strategies, and a series of tests---one test for each
strategy. The tests check that the paths of the program are explored in
the correct order for each strategy.

If you write a new strategy (invoked through `cbmc --paths my-strategy`),
you should write a `my-strategy.in` file in each subdirectory of
cbmc-path-strategies. The my-strategy.in file should contain the order
you expect to see the paths being explored for the main.c file in that
directory.

The test description files, my-strategy.desc, are generated from the .in
files using the script scripts/gen_descs.py.
